# Landing Page Mockup
This is a project based on an assignment in the "Odin Project" online curriculum.
The idea is to use HTML and CSS to create a landing page with a header, body, and footer.
It incorporates CSS formatting with flexbox as well as various styling changes like shadows,
backgrounds, text editing and more.
